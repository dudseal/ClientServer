<h2  style="padding-left:40px"  >We have been working hard throughout the past 12 weeks to be able to show you our work... So lets go over it.</h2>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3  style="padding-left:40px" >               We started by creating a presention, and after a semi-failed attempt, we believe it ended up pretty good. </h3>

<ol>
<p style="padding-left:40px" >           So what <i>did</i> we learn?? </p>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           Teamwork </li>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           Wireshark! </li>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           IPV4 </li>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           The order of internet </li>

<h2 style="padding-left:40px" > Then, we got to <b> WORK </b></h2>

<h3 style="padding-left:40px" > We had little to no skill in the cloud building field, and it showed... because after Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and the router software were intalled, we hit a road block. A very <big>BIG</big> roadblock </h3>

<h3 style="padding-left:40px" > WAN, LAN, OPTI1.. what did it all mean???
    <br><br>
    Luckily, we had perserverance on our side.. and reddit.   <br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, we made our a rule so that traffic could freely flow in and out of our servers unstopped.. and all was well

</h3>
<br><br><br>
<h2 style="padding-left:40px" > Now, there seems to be a gap in time, what where those weeks made up of?</h2>
<h3 style ="padding: 80px"> Simply <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trial and error. It took a long time to figure out the problem was rules, instead, we thought it was: the firewall on ubuntu, parkway, the computers not being powerful enough, our own lack of knowlage, and finally, the ips being incompatiable. Of course, eventually we learned why all of those were incorrect, and in the mean time we learn a  lot of about cloud devoplement</h3>


<h2> Then, on our final days, we learned about python servers, and with a little help from chat gpt for understanding python.. it was light work. While Stephen and Garrick troubleshot the few last issues, Camden wrote this HTML page with the little knowlage he learned 3 years ago, and w3schools.</h2>

<h2> If we had to do this again, we think we could do it in a week, because of how much that we have learned. Kenneth, thank you for this chance to learn something cool and new, and the ability do it in a way that our knowlage will stick with us forever. </h2>

<h3>What we learned</h3>
<h4>Camden</h4>
    <p>I think I learned about teamwork because usually I work alone, but I was forced into a more together job. I needed to be a team player and because of this 
        I believe that I learned how to be a better teamate by talking, suggesting, and asking. I also learned about the importance of learning. I needed to learn
         a lot of new skills in order to do my fair share in this project and it needed to be effective and efficent. By the end, I think I accomplished that.</p>
<h4>Garrick</h4>
    <p>I learned about important skills one should seek to be proficiant in to become successfull in tech jobs. <br> In addition, I learned a very important skill 
        to be able to take a step back when things don't initially work as they should. Patience is a very important skill to have when working with a group.</p>
<h4>Stephen</h4>
    <p>I had a lot of fun on this project! I learned that I get in the weeds way too fast and tend to assume the problem is deeper than it actualy is:
    For example, I thought the firewall was blocking traffic between the computers when I had actually just changed one digit of the IP I was pinging. It's still really cool 
    every time the webpage opens on the other computer - I've never done a project where data has to move between computers. If I ever build my own router I think I'll take a 
    course on OpnSense because I still only have a basic understanding on how the router is configured. </p>
