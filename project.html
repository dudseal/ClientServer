<h2  style="padding-left:40px"  >We have been working hard throughout the past 12 weeks to be able to show you our work... So lets go over it.</h2>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3  style="padding-left:40px" >               We started by creating a presention, and after a semi-failed attempt, we believe it ended up pretty good. </h3>

<ol>
<p style="padding-left:40px" >           So what <i>did</i> we learn?? </p>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           Teamwork </li>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           Wireshark! </li>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           IPV4 </li>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           The order of internet </li>
<li style="padding-left:40px" >           Finally, patience </li>
<ol>

<h2 style="padding-left:40px" > Then, we got to <b> WORK </b></h2>

<h3 style="padding-left:40px" > We had little to no skill in the cloud building field, and it showed... because after Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and the router software were intalled, we hit a road block. A very <big>BIG</big> roadblock </h3>

<h3 style="padding-left:40px" > WAN, LAN, OPTI1.. what did it all mean???
    <br><br>
    Luckily, we had perserverance on our side.. and reddit.   <br>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, we made our a rule so that traffic could freely flow in and out of our servers unstopped.. and all was well

</h3>
<br><br><br>
<h2 style="padding-left:40px" > Now, there seems to be a gap in time, what where those weeks made up of?</h2>
<h3 style ="padding: 80px"> Simply <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trial and error. It took a long time to figure out the problem was rules, instead, we thought it was: the firewall on ubuntu, parkway, the computers not being powerful enough, our own lack of knowlage, and finally, the ips being incompatiable. Of course, eventually we learned why all of those were incorrect, and in the mean time we learn a  lot of about cloud devoplement</h3>


<h2> Then, on our final days, we learned about python servers, and with a little help from chat gpt for understanding python.. it was light work. While Stephen and Garrick troubleshot the few last issues, Camden wrote this HTML page with the little knowlage he learned 3 years ago, and w3schools.</h2>

<h2> If we had to do this again, we think we could do it in a week, because of how much that we have learned. Kenneth, thank you for this chance to learn something cool and new, and the ability do it in a way that our knowlage will stick with us forever. </h2>
